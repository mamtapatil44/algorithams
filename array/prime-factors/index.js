// 1. define num whose largent primefactor we need to calculate
// 2. write fun whcih takes number as para
// 3. create a variable which store current factor and set it two
// 4. create a varibale which stores the largest factor and set it to 1
// 5. use while loop for iteration
// 6.check current factor is factor of number then then thait is prime number
// 7. if it is factor and factor of prime then update largest fact
// 8. if not current fact increase by 1 and iterate loop
